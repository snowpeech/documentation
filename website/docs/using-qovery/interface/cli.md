Qovery provides a very easy to use CLI (Command Line Interface) designed to perfectly fit the developer workflow.

<Alert type="warning">

When you type a command, the CLI is aware of your current [project][docs.main-concepts.project], [application][docs.main-concepts.application] and [environment][docs.main-concepts.environment]. Which is very convenient!

## First usage

### Install

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className={"rounded"}
  defaultValue={"linux"}
  placeholder="Select your OS"
  select={false}
  size={null}
  values={[{"group":"Platforms","label":"Linux","value":"linux"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"MacOS","value":"macos"},{"group":"Platforms","label":"Windows","value":"windows"}]}>

<TabItem value="linux">

```bash
# Download and install Qovery CLI on every Linux distribution
$ curl -s https://get.qovery.com | sudo bash
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="macos">

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className="rounded"
  defaultValue="homebrew"
  values={[{"label":"Homebrew","value":"homebrew"},{"label":"Manual","value":"manual"}]}>

<TabItem value="homebrew">

The common solution to install a command line binary on the MacOS is to use [Homebrew][urls.brew].

```bash
# Add Qovery brew repository
$ brew tap Qovery/qovery-cli

# Install the CLI
$ brew install qovery-cli
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual">

```bash
# Install the Qovery CLI on MacOS manually
$ curl -s https://get.qovery.com | bash
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="windows">

<Tabs
  centered={true}
  className="rounded"
  defaultValue="scoop"
  values={[{"label":"Scoop","value":"scoop"},{"label":"Manual","value":"manual"}]}>

<TabItem value="scoop">

The classic way to install binaries on Windows is to use [Scoop][urls.scoop].

```bash
# Add Qovery bucket
$ scoop bucket add qovery https://github.com/Qovery/scoop-qovery-cli

# Install the CLI
$ scoop install qovery-cli
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="manual">

Install the Qovery CLI on Windows manually by downloading the [latest release][urls.qovery_cli_releases], and uncompress its content to
`C:\Windows`.

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Few limitations exist on Windows: [read more][docs.cli#windows]

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

### Sign up

```bash
# Sign up and sign in command
$ qovery auth
```

<Alert type="info">

If you are using an environment without access to GUI or a browser, you can use headless authentication instead:

```bash
# Sign up and sign in command
$ qovery auth --headless
```

</Alert>

Your browser window with sign-in options will open.

[Click here][urls.authorize_qovery] to authorize Qovery to clone and build your applications.

## Limitations

### Windows

**ANSI Color codes**: *Powershell* does not natively support ANSI color codes. [Some tricks exist to make it work](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51681675/560638).
The more accessible it is to use `qovery <command> | Out-Host` when you need to show colors.
